# Testing Star & Delete Functionality

## Test Plan

### 1. Star Functionality Test
1. Open the app at http://localhost:3001
2. On the homepage, you should see boards
3. Click the star icon (outline) next to any board
4. The board should move to the top section (starred boards)
5. The star should become filled (yellow)
6. Click the filled star to unstar
7. The board should move back to the date-grouped section

### 2. Delete Functionality Test
1. Hover over any board
2. A delete icon should appear on the right
3. Click the delete icon
4. A confirmation dialog should appear
5. Click "OK" to confirm
6. The board should disappear from the list

### 3. Persistence Test
1. Star a board
2. Delete another board
3. Refresh the page
4. Starred board should remain starred
5. Deleted board should remain deleted

## Console Commands for Debugging

```javascript
// Check board store status
boardStore.getBoards()

// Check if listeners are registered
boardStore.changeListeners

// Manually toggle star
boardStore.toggleBoardStar('board-id-here')

// Manually delete board
boardStore.deleteBoard('board-id-here')

// Check storage
localStorage.getItem('lumina_' + userIdentity.userId + '_boards')
```

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **Star Toggle Method**: `boardStore.toggleBoardStar(boardId)`
- Updates `isStarred` property
- Saves to storage
- Notifies listeners with 'board_star_toggled' event

✅ **Delete Method**: `boardStore.deleteBoard(boardId)`
- Removes from boards array
- Cleans up node data
- Handles active board deletion
- Saves to storage
- Notifies listeners with 'board_deleted' event

✅ **UI Implementation**:
- Star/unstar icons with click handlers
- Delete icons with confirmation
- Separate sections for starred/unstarred boards
- Change listener for auto-refresh

## Fixed Issues
- ✅ Fixed change listener cleanup (was calling wrong method)
