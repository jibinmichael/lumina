# AI Synthesis Engine Setup Guide

## 🚀 **What You've Just Built**

The AI Synthesis Engine is now fully integrated into Lumina Notes! This silent cognitive mirror will:

- **Listen** to everything you type across all nodes
- **Synthesize** your thoughts without adding new ideas
- **Organize** your thinking using your own language and tone
- **Update** automatically as you work (3-second debounce)
- **Reference** specific nodes with IDs (N001, N002, etc.)

## 📋 **Prerequisites**

1. **OpenAI API Key**: You'll need an OpenAI API key to use the synthesis engine
2. **Internet Connection**: Required for AI processing
3. **Modern Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions**

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Go to **API Keys** section
4. Click **"Create new secret key"**
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)
6. **Important**: Save this key securely - you won't see it again!

### Step 2: Configure the AI Engine

1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open side panel**: Look for the side panel toggle
3. **Click Settings** icon (⚙️) in the side panel header
4. **Enter your API key** in the dialog
5. **Click "Save & Enable"**

### Step 3: Test the Integration

1. **Create some nodes** with content
2. **Watch the side panel** - synthesis should appear automatically
3. **Check the status indicator** - should show "Updated" with ✅
4. **Try different content** - synthesis will update after you stop typing

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Real-time Synthesis**
- Type in any node → AI processes after 3 seconds
- Switch boards → Synthesis loads for that board
- Manual controls → Refresh or clear synthesis anytime

### **Node References**
- Each node gets an ID: N001, N002, N003...
- Synthesis references these IDs for traceability
- You can trace every synthesized point back to source

### **Storage & Privacy**
- API key stored locally in browser
- Synthesis history saved per board
- No data sent to external servers (except OpenAI)

## 🎨 **UI Features**

### **Side Panel Enhancements**
- **Status Chip**: Shows Processing → Updated → Error states
- **Manual Controls**: Refresh and clear synthesis
- **Settings Dialog**: Secure API key management
- **Auto-sync**: Synthesis updates with node changes

### **Visual Indicators**
- 🟠 **Processing**: AI is analyzing your content
- 🟢 **Updated**: Fresh synthesis available
- 🔴 **Error**: Check your API key or connection
- 🔵 **Ready**: AI engine ready to synthesize

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **"Failed to initialize AI service"**
   - Check your API key is valid
   - Ensure you have OpenAI credits
   - Verify internet connection

2. **"Synthesis not updating"**
   - Check if AI toggle is enabled
   - Verify nodes have content
   - Look for error messages in console

3. **"Processing stuck"**
   - Refresh the page
   - Clear synthesis and try again
   - Check browser console for errors

### **API Key Issues**
- Make sure key starts with `sk-`
- Check OpenAI account has credits
- Verify key hasn't expired
- Try regenerating the key

## 🚀 **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] API key setup works
- [ ] Synthesis appears when typing in nodes
- [ ] Status indicator updates correctly
- [ ] Manual refresh works
- [ ] Clear synthesis works
- [ ] Board switching preserves synthesis
- [ ] Node references appear (N001, N002, etc.)
- [ ] Auto-save integration works
- [ ] Error handling displays properly

## 📊 **Performance Notes**

- **Debounce Timing**: 3-second delay prevents excessive API calls
- **Incremental Updates**: Only processes changed content
- **Memory Management**: Cleans up timers and listeners
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API failures

## 🔮 **What's Next**

The AI Synthesis Engine is now ready to be your silent thinking partner! As you use it:

1. **It learns your style** - Adapts to your language patterns
2. **It stays invisible** - Never interrupts your flow
3. **It organizes naturally** - Groups thoughts logically
4. **It references precisely** - Every point traces back to nodes

Enjoy your enhanced thinking experience! 🧠✨

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

- **Use descriptive node content** for better synthesis
- **Create connections between nodes** for richer context
- **Switch boards freely** - each has its own synthesis
- **Edit synthesis directly** if needed (it's just markdown)
- **Share synthesis** using the share button
